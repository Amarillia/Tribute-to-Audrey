						<p>Here's a time line of Audrey Hepburn's life:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>1929</strong> - Born in Brussels, Belgium</li>
							<li><strong>1934</strong> - Sent to boarding school in England by her mother.</li>
							<li><strong>1935</strong> - Her father walks out on the family leaving no forwarding
								address. Audrey begins to taking ballet classes.</li>
							<li><strong>1938</strong> - Her parents formally divorce. At Audrey's pleading her father
								is given visitation rights" but he subsequently fails to exercise them.</li>
							<li><strong>1939</strong> - Preceding the outbreak of WWII, Ella wrongly considers neutral
								Holland safer than the risk of staying in England, and moves Audrey back to live with
								the family in Arnhem.
								Audrey is forced to quickly learn Dutch, her being fluent only in English at this time.</li>
							<li><strong>1940</strong> - In May, German troops and artillery march through Arnhem. Dutch
								resources are exploited fully by Germany and, in time, virtually all of the van
								Heemstra family's property will be confiscated: property, homes, bank accounts,
								securities, jewelry.
								Due to her British citizenship, and fear of internment, Ella warns Audrey not to speak
								English in public.
								At this time, in England, Joseph Ruston is among hundreds of fascist or pro-Nazi
								activists imprisoned without trial" this unknown to his wife and daughter.</li>
							<li><strong>1941</strong> - Audrey begins her first serious ballet training under Winja
								Marova at the Arnhem School of Music. She will study there through to mid 1944,
								becoming the teacher's star pupil in the process.
								By spring it is hard to get the single weekly rationed egg, let alone meat; by summer
								there is no tea of coffee. During winter the fuel shortage means that only one room per
								home is allowed to be heated.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1942</strong> - Audrey's Uncle and four others are executed by the Nazis purely
								for publicity and retribution for a Dutch underground attempt to blow up a train.
								Alexander goes underground to avoid being rounded up to work in forced labor for the
								Germans. Ian is caught and is sent to work fourteen hours a day in a munitions factory
								in Berlin or "for all his family knows‚Äù to his death.
								Ella and Audrey, now on their own, are taken in by her grandfather, Baron van Heemstra,
								and Ella's widowed sister, in nearby Velp.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1943</strong> - Despite the occupation Audrey draws herself more deeply into
								music and dance, finding an outlet for her talents in a series of "blackout
								performances," held in secret with locked windows and drawn blinds. They also serve as
								a fundraising activity for the Resistance. During the war Audrey also acts as a courier
								and occasional secret messenger for the Resistance, as children often did, carrying
								messages and illegal leaflets stuffed in socks and shoes.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1944</strong> - Audrey helps instruct the youngest students in the School. She
								also earns her family money by giving under-the-table private lessons. Eventually,
								however, food becomes so scarce that it weakens Audrey enough so that she must stop
								dancing temporarily.
								The Battle of Arnhem begins on September 17. After several days fighting the victorious
								Germans order all citizens to leave within twenty-four hours or risk being shot on
								sight. Ella and her daughter watch the exodus from the relative safety of the Baron's
								villa.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Winter, 1944 - 1945</strong> - The fifteen-year-old Hepburn starts dancing
								again, giving classes in one of the rooms of the house. But soon, the Germans order
								everybody out.
								Audrey appears with other students at Arnhem's municipal theater in a recital that wins
								attention from a magazine critic, who writes: "She seems obsessed by a real dance rage,
								and already has a respectable technical proficiency."
							</li>
							<li><strong>1945</strong> - March, and Audrey barely escapes as German soldiers round up
								young women to staff their military kitchens. Her hiding place is back at home where
								she stays indoors for the next month.
								Holland is liberated on Audrey's sixteenth birthday, May 4.
								Audrey is now five-foot-six and weighs ninety pounds, suffering from asthma, jaundice
								and other diseases due to malnutrition, including anemia and severe edema. Also, her
								metabolism is permanently affected, leading in future to difficulty gaining weight, as
								well as erroneous rumours of eating disorders for years to come.
								Alexander emerges from underground hiding, followed soon by the arrival of Ian who has
								walked most of the way from Berlin.
								Ella reapplies herself to Audrey's career, and decides to relocate them both to
								Amsterdam. Audrey starts studying there with Sonia Gaskell, the leading name in Dutch
								ballet. Audrey can't pay for the lessons, but Gaskell thinks she deserves a chance, and
								she becomes a very serious pupil.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1946</strong> - Audrey is chosen to dance with Gaskell's top student star in a
								matinee performance at Amsterdam's Hortus theatre.
								Audrey is introduced by a friend to a photographer, at whose studio she begins to do
								some posing, quickly developing a natural feel for it. At this stage, largely ignorant
								of the film world, Audrey's ambitions lie in dance.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1948</strong> - With her mother, Audrey visits London briefly where she
								auditions for the celebrated Marie Lambert ballet school. She is accepted with
								scholarship, however her enrollment is postponed due to lack of funds.
								Back in the Netherlands, Audrey performs a screentest for a pair of freelance Dutch
								filmmakers, who give her her first small film role" that of a stewardess" in the film
								Nederlands in Zeven Lessen (Dutch in Seven Lessons).
								Late in the year, Audrey and her mother leave for London to partake of her scholarship.
								Ella would try to track down Ruston in England but fail. Ella supports them through a
								series of humble jobs, and finally obtains a job "combined with a flat" managing a
								block of Mayfair flats. Meanwhile Rambert generously takes Audrey into her home,
								housing and feeding her there for six months. Audrey concentrates totally on dance
								until the need for money leads her to weekend work as a model.
								Despite her ambitions for the ballet, Audrey increasingly acknowledges that because of
								her limitations" her height and comparative lack of training" that her future is not to
								be in the ballet. Audrey declines an offer from a company for an overseas tour and
								instead tries out for the chorus line of High Button Shoes. Audrey is one of the ten"
								out of a thousand that try-out" that get the job. She has one line, "Have they all
								gone?". The show runs for 291 performances.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1949</strong> - After being noticed in High Button Shoes, Audrey is cast in
								Sauce Tartare. After 433 performances the play is refreshed as Sauce Piquante" in which
								Audrey returns to a bigger part. She would also do a "bit of TV" at this time. Marcel
								le Bon, a young French singer in Sauce Piquant becomes her first serious boyfriend, if
								only briefly. In between the two Sauces, Audrey works to develop her performing skills
								with choreography and elocution lessons.
								Audrey is offered by Associated British Pictures Corp. a major role in Laughter in
								Paradise, however she only signs after the bookings for a show fall through and le Bon
								leaves for America. By now she is only able to secure a small part as "cigarette girl."
								Audrey performs another small part in One Wild Oat, and then goes on to a small role in
								Young Wives' Tale. She is then loaned out to Ealing Studios for The Lavender Hill Mob.
								The film is named best film of 1951, although Audrey's contribution goes unnoticed by
								the studio.
								Shortly after finishing The Lavender Hill Mob, Audrey finds a serious relationship in
								28 year-old James Hanson, multimillionaire scion of a Yorkshire trucking family.
								Audrey's mother thinks him a good stable match for her.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1951</strong> - Audrey gets a major supporting role in The Secret People. The
								role utilises her ballet skills and one dramatic scene evokes memories of the Arnhem
								bombing. During this production she is offered her next role: Nous Irons √É Monte Carlo,
								shot on location on the French Riviera.
								During the shoot, in a chance encounter with the film crew in a hotel lobby, Colette
								sees Audrey and thinks her perfect for the lead role in her Gigi. Although Audrey's
								subsequent reading is disappointing, she gains the part at Colette's insistence.
								Audrey screen tests in London for the lead role of the princess in William Wyler's
								Roman Holiday. Wyler views her performance later and finds her irresistable. Now signed
								for a Hollywood movie as well as a Broadway play, Audrey leaves on her own at the first
								time without her mother for New York.
								Gigi rehearsals begin in October, however Audrey's auditions are substandard. After
								much hard work, and much-needed vocal coaching, she steadily improves, even up till
								opening night. The majority of newspapers give low marks to the play but kudos to
								Audrey.
								During Hanson's visit for the Gigi premiere, Audrey accepts his diamond ring to
								formalise their engagement. His work is split between NYC, Toronto, and Britain, and
								during Gigi he and Audrey spend a lot of time together.
								After her Gigi success, Audrey resumes her voice coaching, and her dance instructions
								at the Tarassova School of Ballet in New York City.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1952</strong> - On May 31, Gigi closes early in New York since Paramount is
								eager to get started on Roman Holiday, for which there is a narrow shooting schedule.
								Audrey goes straight to Rome immediately after closing night, with her wedding having
								been planned for between the play and film that spring postponed.
								Roman Holiday is completed in September and Audrey learns much from the experience. On
								this film Audrey begins her life-long collaboration and friendship with Edith Head.
								Wedding plans are put off again as Audrey goes straight into the American road tour of
								Gigi, lasting eight months. Midway through, Audrey announces her engagement over. It is
								an amicable split and they continue to see each other.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1953</strong> - Roman Holiday opens in the U.S. in August, and audiences and
								critics love it. Audrey's "look" becomes all the rage and is followed by fashion
								magazines everywhere.
								In London in July for the British opening of Roman Holiday, Audrey first meets Mel
								Ferrer at a f√É¬™te hosted by her mother. Mel is twice-divorced, a father of four, an
								actor, stage and film director and twelve years her senior.
								September, and Audrey begins shooting Sabrina on Long Island. The nine-week shoot is
								followed by time in Hollywood for retakes. On this film Audrey begins her lasting
								relationship with Givenchy, who designs the fashion costumes worn by Sabrina.
								Ferrer sends Audrey the script for Broadway's Ondine. She loves it and agrees to the
								role, securing Mel as costar.
								At the end of Sabrina, and before the start of Ondine rehearsals two weeks later,
								Audrey moves back to New York, where her mother later arrives soon after.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1954</strong> - Ondine premiers on February 18th to rave reviews. Audrey now
								learns she has been nominated for an Academy Award for Roman Holiday, and on March 25
								she is awarded Best Actress. Three days after and Audrey is awarded again: the Tony
								award for best stage actress in Ondine.
								Three months into Ondine, Audrey is suffering from exhaustion, smoking a pack of
								cigarettes a day and fifteen pounds underweight. On advice from her doctors to rest she
								quits, and so Ondine closes on July 3 after 157 performances. At the end of the month
								she flys to an alpine resort Switzerland, where after a week of media imprisonment she
								finally finds respite at a villa in Bargenstock.
								August, and Mel Ferrer flies to Switzerland and formerly proposes, and Audrey accepts
								over Ella's objection. On September 24 they are married in a civil cermony at Buoche,
								on the shores of Lake Lucerne. The next day they repeat their vows at a religious
								ceremony in a chapel below the mountain at Bargenstock. After a four-day honeymoon near
								Bargenstock she and Mel enjoy a week together near Cinecitta Studios, Italy, where he
								was filming La Madre. They return to Bargenstock where they learn that Audrey is now
								pregnant. For the rest of her life Audrey would now call Switzerland her home.
								In November Audrey makes her first return to Holland on the invitation of the League of
								Dutch Military War Invalids for a five-day fundraising tour.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1955</strong> - February, and Audrey receives her second her second Oscar
								nomination, for Sabrina, but loses to Grace Kelly in A Country Girl.
								In March, Audrey has a miscarriage. She and Mel grieve privately.
								The Ferrers both sign under producer Dino De Laurentiis for War and Peace. In spring
								they go to Italy where shooting begins on July 4. Because of the ten-hour days, and her
								miscarriage and general frailty, Audrey would later call her role of Natasha the
								toughest role she ever did. Although the film will receive generally negative reviews,
								many reviewers praise her portrayal of Natasha.
								Audrey is now deluged with script offers, most of which either fall through for
								whatever reason or she rejects including two dozen from Associated British. Her next
								film project will instead be Funny Face, with Fred Astaire.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1956</strong> - Funny Face is shot in three months in Hollywood, followed by a
								month in Paris. Audrey and Mel are together the whole time while Ella, based in London,
								makes several trips to visit her daughter in Paris. Now included in her contract,
								Givenchy designs all of Audrey's film clothes.
								Audrey returns home for four weeks rest before Love in the Afternoon, again with Billy
								Wilder. She is coupled with Gary Cooper twenty-eight years her senior. During the shoot
								in Paris Audrey makes trips on weekends to the south of France to join Mel, where he is
								filming The Vintage.
								Audrey leaves Europe to spend Christmas at La Quinta, a desert resort near Palm
								Springs, with Mel and his children, Pepa and Mark.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1957</strong> - January, and the Ferrers begin work on the television movie
								Mayerling, which takes a week of rehearsal then two weeks taping at the NBC studios.
								Mayerling airs February 4, and although it garners a large audience the reviews are
								bad. On the basis of its failure NBC will reject several other proposed Hepburn-Ferrer
								team productions. From now on Ferrer thinks of himself more a producer/director rather
								than costar of the partnership.
								In need of a rest, Audrey chooses to reject all movie offers while she accompanies her
								husband to Spain and Mexico for the shooting of The Sun Also Rises. Among those films
								she would reject is The Diary of Ann Frank, which she finds "too painful" and too close
								to her wartime experiences. Audrey, urged by Mel, signs for The Nun's Story as her next
								film, which is to be soon followed by Mel's own project to star Audrey, Green Mansions.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1958</strong> - Filming for The Nun's Story begins in Rome's Cinecitta Studios,
								and then followed by the difficult stint on location in the Belgian Congo. For the
								conclusion of the shoot, back in Rome, the crew works is forced to work around Audrey
								for a time as she is bedridden with kidney stones, partly due to dehydration from
								working so long in the Congo. The film will open on July 18, 1959, and make more money
								that any other Warner Brothers film to date. Hepburn is named Best Actress of 1959 by
								the New York Film Critics and its British equivalent, however the film wins none of the
								eight Oscars it is nominated for, including Audrey for Best Actress.
								Immediately after the conclusion of The Nun's Story shoot, Audrey begins Green Mansions
								in Hollywood. Mel has already spent several months with a crew in British Guiana and
								Venezuela shooting backgrounds. The film is completed in November and eventually
								released prior to the The Nun's Story. The film fails with both critics and
								audiences√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwith Mel as director getting the blame√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùand fails to recoup its
								investment.
								The Ferrers return to B√É¬ºrgenstock for a rest, during which time Audrey again finds
								herself pregnant.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1959</strong> - Audrey's next film is The Unforgiven, shot in Mexico. During
								the shoot she falls off a horse and breaks her back. She is hospitalized with four
								broken vertebrae, torn muscles in her lower back and a badly sprained foot. Ferrer
								immediately joins her as well as Audrey's Hollywood physician and Marie-Louise
								Habets√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe real-life Sister Luke, whom she had gotten to know during The Nun's
								Story√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwho takes personal nursing charge of her. After a month, and with the help of
								an orthopedic brace, Audrey is able to complete the film. When released in April, 1960,
								the film is mostly panned by critics.
								After The Unforgiven, Audrey returns to B√É¬ºrgenstock for the duration of her baby's
								term. But, soon after, she miscarries again due to her fall during The Unforgiven. Mel
								would call it "a tragedy" and said, "it has broken her heart and mine". Audrey goes
								into a deep depression, losing weight and smoking heavily.
								Less than six months later, and Audrey is pregnant again. She refuses all work until
								the baby is born, turning down West Side Story, The Cardinal, plus a later-shelved
								Hitchcock film, No Bail For The Judge. She finally accepts Breakfast at Tiffany's, to
								be commenced only after the birth.
								At some point around this time, Audrey receives erroneous news of her father's death.
								Investigating the rumours, Mel discovers that he is living in Dublin, and he and Audrey
								visit him there (apparently during the latter half of the year). Ruston is familiar
								with his daughter's fame despite their separation, and at age 74 was married again√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùto
								a woman thirty-odd years his junior. The reunion is bittersweet, but from that time
								Audrey sends him a monthly check until he dies, two decades later.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1960</strong> - On July 17, in Lucerne, Switzerland, Audrey Hepburn gives birth
								to Sean Ferrer. He is baptized in the same chapel and by the same pastor who had
								married Audrey and Mel six years earlier.
								The shooting of Breakfast at Tiffany's takes place in New York, followed by some in
								Hollywood. It opens in October, doing less well than the studio hoped, although it does
								exert a significant cultural influence. For this role, Audrey will be nominated for her
								fourth Oscar but again not win.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1961</strong> - Audrey next film is The Children's Hour, which reunites her
								with William Wyler. During the Hollywood shoot Audrey's dog, Mr. Famous, is run over on
								Wilshire Boulevard. Mel quickly assuages her grief by presenting her with a new dog,
								Sam.
								The Ferrers then return to Europe, with Mel departing soon after to Paris for a part in
								The Longest Day.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1962</strong> - Audrey shoots Paris When it Sizzles in Paris. Hepburn and her
								lead, William Holden, are brought together to fulfill Paramount's contractual
								commitments. Wildy overbudget on completion, its creative failure means that it is
								shelved, only to be released two years later.
								Audrey stays on in Paris for Charade. She is finally teamed up with costar Cary Grant,
								who has already twice rejected working with Audrey (Sabrina, Love in the Afternoon) as
								he had been uncomfortable with the age gap. The film will become her biggest box office
								hit as of this time.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1963</strong> - After eight months working without a break, Audrey concludes
								the filming of Charade. The Ferrers return home in Switzerland.
								After months of negotiations between Kurt Frings, her agent, and Warner Brothers,
								Audrey gains the lead role in My Fair Lady. The decision is controversial: producer
								Jack Warner determines that Audrey Hepburn is a better choice for such a costly film
								than Broadway's lead, Julie Andrews√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùat this time a virtual cinematic unknown. Having
								recorded vocal tracks for the film herself, Audrey is shocked to find out that she will
								be dubbed, by Marni Nixon. This dogs her to the Oscars where she fails to receive a
								nomination in the Best Actress category, eventually won by Julie Andrews in her film
								debut, Mary Poppins.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1965</strong> - Audrey teams up again with director William Wyler, in Paris,
								for How to Steal a Million. On completing the shoot the Ferrers exchange their
								B√É¬ºrgenstock home for one in the village of Tolochenaz-sur-Morges. It is called "La
								Paisible," which translates as 'the peaceful place.' They also purchase a winter home
								in Marbella.
								Audrey finds herself pregnant again, but a month later miscarries.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1966</strong> - After turning down many scripts offered her, Audrey accepts Two
								for the Road. The film utilizes Audrey in nearly every scene and she has no time with
								her family. Mel elects to stay at home with Sean, and works on a deal with Frings to
								secure Wait Until Dark for his wife.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1967</strong> - Audrey shoots Wait Until Dark, with her husband as producer.
								Emotionally, the film is difficult as Audrey is privately coping with the
								disintegration of her marriage. Also, she works so hard that she loses almost fifteen
								pounds while filming. The film opens later in the year to great success, and Audrey's
								fifth (and final) Oscar nomination follows.
								Audrey and Mel argue over the future of her career. He wants her to make more movies,
								while Audrey looks forward to spending more time with Sean. Sadly at this time, another
								pregancy follows which again ends in miscarriage.
								The Ferrers plan another Mayerling together√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwith Mel producing the film starring
								Audrey opposite Omar Sharif. Audrey doesn't want to work again so soon with her husband
								so Mel instead casts Catherine Deneuve. Audrey stays at home with Sean while Mel works
								on the film.
								September, and the announcement comes that Audrey and Mel are living apart. Audrey
								doesn't wish to continue work and so asks Frings not to send her any more scripts.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1968</strong> - On November 21 the Ferrer's divorce is announced. Details are
								kept secret, but Audrey retains custody of Sean and the home in Tolochenaz.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1969</strong> - On January 18 Audrey marries Italian psychiatrist-neurologist
								Andrea Dotti whom she met on a private cruise in June of the previous year. There is no
								formal honeymoon and the couple settle down in Rome, with Sean enrolled in a bilingual
								school there. Audrey retains La Paisible as a weekend retreat and summer home, its
								staff supervised by Baroness van Heemstra who now lives there year-round.
								Four months into marriage Audrey discovers she is pregnant. She retreats to La Paisible
								to take extra precaution against the worst.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1970</strong> - Luca Dotti is born on February 8 in a Caesarean delivery.
								Audrey settles into motherhood, and despite later reports of her nightclubbing husband
								being in the company of other women, she would claim a happiness and contentment in her
								role as a Roman wife and mother.
								Although "retired" Audrey announces a willingness to act, but only in Rome. She turns
								down Forty Carats and Nicholas and Alexandria because she thinks herself too old.
								Finally she becomes more interested in her husband's profession, accompanying him on
								lectures and other job-related missions.
								In rare a excursion into show business Audrey works on a UNICEF television special, and
								in the next year on a series of Japanese wig commercials.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1974</strong> - Audrey suffers her fifth miscarriage.

							</li>
							<li><strong>1975</strong> - After rejecting many scripts, Audrey is finally brought out of
								her "retirement" by Robin and Marian, to star opposite Sean Connery.
								Robin and Marian is filmed in Spain, in six weeks√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùa pace she is unaccustomed to in
								her experience from earlier films. Her return will be welcomed by fans and critics
								alike, although reviews of the film are mixed.
								Once the movie is completed, the couple start to receive anonymous kidnapping threats
								for Sean and Luca. For safety, Audrey relocates them to Switzerland. Soon afterward,
								there is an attempt to abduct Dr. Dotti as he leaves his clinic but his cries attract
								security guards which foils the attempt. Audrey needs no further inducement to remain
								in Tolochenaz.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1976</strong> - Audrey flies to the U.S. for the dual purpose of the Robin and
								Marian premiere at Radio City Music Hall and her appearance at the American Film
								Institute's honoring of seventy-three-year-old William Wyler.
								Dr. Dotti joins her later at the Academy Awards ceremony, at which Audrey - greeted on
								stage by a standing ovation from her peers - presents the Best Picture Oscar to
								producer Michael Douglas for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
								Robin and Marian brings Audrey offers, including A Bridge Too Far and Richard's Things,
								which for one reason or another she turns down.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1979</strong> - During their marriage Dotti's role as husband continues to
								include going out with young women; and, embarrassingly, his outings are duly recorded
								in the newspapers. Although confidantes know of Audrey's unhappiness, she would
								continue to protect their marriage by insisting that they had their differences and,
								like any couple, that they were "basically happy."
								Audrey agrees to star in the Sidney Sheldon thriller, Bloodline. After shooting, Audrey
								returns to Rome.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1980</strong> - Audrey decides on a small role in Peter Bogdanovich's comedy,
								They All Laughed, filmed in Manhattan. Sean Ferrer doubles as production assistant and
								has a small acting role.
								September, and Dotti's stepfather announces the long-anticipated news that the marriage
								between Audrey and Dr. Dotti is officially ended. Audrey has already met Robert Wolders
								with whom she finds much common-ground, from mutual interests to similar European
								backgrounds.
								News of her father's serious illness brings Audrey and Wolders closer together as he
								accompanies her on the emotionally difficult trip to Dublin to visit him for the last
								time. He dies three days after their arrival.
								Wolders would eventually move in with Audrey at La Paisible. By now Audrey is looking
								after her elderly mother, now a frail invalid.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1982</strong> - The Dotti divorce is finalized, although Audrey doesn't make
								any attempt to legalize her relationship with Wolders.
								Wolders accompanies Audrey to Los Angeles for the American Film Institute Tribute to
								Fred Astaire, as well as to other parts of the world on other missions.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1984</strong> - On August 26, Baroness Ella van Heemstra dies at La Paisible at
								the age of eighty-four. It leaves Audrey bereft: "I was lost without my mother. She had
								been my sounding board, my conscience. She was not the most affectionate person√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùin
								fact there were times when I thought she was cold√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùbut she loved me in her heart, and
								I knew that all a long. I never got that feeling from my father, unfortunately."
							</li>
							<li><strong>1985</strong> - Sean Ferrer is married, making Audrey a mother-in-law, although
								the relationship only lasts until 1989. Audrey attends the ceremony with Wolders, while
								Mel is also present in the company of Lisa, his wife of fourteen years. As parents of
								the groom, Audrey and Mel dance together for the first time in seventeen years.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1986</strong> - Audrey is among notables interviewed for Directed by William
								Wyler, a well-received documentary tribute produced by Wyler's daughter.
							</li>
							<li><strong>1987</strong> - Audrey makes the television movie, Love Among Thieves, opposite
								Richard Wagner. It attracts mostly negative reviews and is Audrey's last starring role.
								Audrey is officially appointed Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, an organization she'd
								previously helped with fundraising events. With both sons now living away from home
								(Luca is now living with his father in Rome), the role reflects her ability to now
								devote herself more fully to this work.
								In her new UNICEF role, accompanied by Wolders, Audrey visits Macao and then Japan,
								after which requests pour in from UNICEF committees all over the world requesting her
								appearances. Before the end of the year she also visits Ireland.
							</li>
